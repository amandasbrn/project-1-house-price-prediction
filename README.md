# project-1-house-price-prediction

Hello everyone!~

To kick off my journey in machine learning, I decided to make a real estate house price prediction.  While this may be considered a typical prediction task within the vast field of machine learning, it is a great project to understand how machine learning algorithm works. 

For this project, I want to predict a real estate house price from existing data of other houses' ages, year of the transaction, distance to the nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores, and house price.

To spice up the project, I made a user input so that the user can input based on their needs and get the prediction based on what they inputed.
